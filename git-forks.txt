NAME
----
git-forks - A utility for interfacing with remote forks

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git forks' list [-n|--nonlocal] [-u|--upstream <remote>]
'git forks' add [-a|--all|<forkname>] [-x|--exclude <forkname>]
		 [-u|--upstream <remote>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Use `git forks` when you want to operate on local remotes connected
to remotely-hosted repositories, provided by services such as
GitHub or Bitbucket. This command allows you to list all available
remote forks, as well as add one, several, or all as locally-tracked
remotes.


OPTIONS
-------

add [-a|--all|<forkname>] [-x|--exclude <forkname>] [-u|--upstream <remote>]::

	Add a remote fork as a locally-tracked remote.
+
If the `--all` option is used, all available forks will be added as
locally-tracked remotes.  The `--exclude` option can be used in conjuction
with `--all` to prevent one or more forks from being added, specified by
their names (see 'list').
+
If the `--upstream` option is used, the named remote is used as the root
repository for the purpose of finding hosted forks.  The default action
assumes 'origin'.
+
If one or more fork names are listed (see 'list') only those remotes will
be added locally.

list [-n|--nonlocal] [-u|--upstream <remote>]::

	List the available forks.  Forks which are already tracked locally
	as remotes are indicated visually.
+
If the `--upstream` option is used, the named remote is used as the root
repository for the purpose of finding hosted forks.  The default action
assumes 'origin'.
+
If the `--nonlocal` option is used, only forks which are not currently
locally-tracked are shown.


DISCUSSION
----------

A fork is workflow-specific concept which implies a hierarchy not
inherently native to git.  This command grafts the ability to work
with them, as encouraged by various repository hosting providers,
onto the command line.
